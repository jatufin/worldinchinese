<p>
World is smaller, it is said. And communications is everything, but English oftentimes short of enough. Learning new languages on this shrinking globe is not always an easy task. 
</p>
<p>
Chinese is the language of the future, is also said. Fifteen hundred million people speaking at least some of the dialects and using those fascinating symbols, called Chinese characters. But taking into account some five thousand years since first texts were carved on turtle shells, it is definitely also a language of the past. What seemed good for ancients, might taste ancient for todayers.</p>
<p>
There are quirks every post adolescence foreign language student encounters, but with Chinese two are more dreadful than others: <em>tones</em> and <em>characters.</em>
</p>
</td>
<td width="50%" align="left" valign="top">
<p>
With tones it is usually zero sum game: You learn them and you survive, or you won't and perish you must. Trying to speak tonal languages without tones is as believable as speaking English without vowels.</p>
<p>
Characters might not seem so bleak. After all, if you can speak the language without understanding a word of its writing, you can still communicate. There are billions of illiterate people in the world.</p>
<p>
Being  illiterate in the world of Internet? That seems very bleak a future indeed.</p>
<p><u>
This application, <em>World in Chinese</em>, is designed to help the student of Chinese to pass some higher peaks of the learning curve in fun and intuitive way.</u></p>

<tr><td colspan="2"><h2>Study Chinese with proper nouns</h2></td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" align="left" valign="top">
<p>
There are two reasons why it is useful to learn  names in Chinese. First is obvious. Proper nouns are as central part of language as any other word classes. If you don't know enough of them, you don't know the language. Imagine someone arriving USA and not knowing what <em>New York</em> or <em>Smith</em> means.</p>
<p>
So names are essential part of culture. And when you are learning language, you are essentially learning also culture. You have to learn Chinese names of Chinese places and moreover where those place physically are.</p>
</td>
<td width="50%" align="left" valign="top">
<p>
But there is also peculiar way Chinese language is used when foreign language words are written down. Characters aren't especially phonetic, but in loan words, e.g. Foreign country names, single syllables are stacked on line to produce word which sounds more or less like original name. These are situations, when single characters have only phonetic value and actual meaning of the character have little use.</p>
<p>
Studying country names is easy way to fast progress in modern Chinese, where more and more terms are imported from outside.</p>
<p>
Besides. Geography is fun and useful in its own rights!</p>

This program has been tested under Windows 2000, XP and Vista operating systems, and is delivered with standard Windows installer. Application is fully stand alone, and there no special requirements. (such as East Asian font support)</p>
<p>
Normal disclaimers apply. That is: no warranties, and no responsibilities for the author.</p>
</td>
<td align="center" valign="top" width="50%">
<p>
In cases you are interested in using the program in other systems than Windows, please contact author. <em>World in Chinese</em> should run without problems in most Linux and Mac OS X systems, but packaging isn't ready yet.</p>
<p>
And what about look and feel? The application looks and feels very much like its author wanted. Call it then <i>minimalistic scandinavian style</i>, but do not complain in vain.</p>

This is small project which started from my personal needs. <em>All's fair in Love and War.</em> Same apply to language learning. Especially when language is as hard as Chinese and learner as hard skulled as I. So every tiny piece of help is always welcome during that thousand <i>Li</i> yourney to language comprehension.</p>
</td>
<td align="center" valign="top" width="50%">
<p>
I wrote the code. And after adding a few units noticed, that playing with the program daily was quite fun and somewhat useful. I thought someone else might find it fun and useful too. And as a broke bloke I am, I also thought that that someone might pay me a few bucks just for that fun. <i>Xiexie</i></p>
